Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression
This project showcases sentiment analysis using logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm. Sentiment analysis involves categorizing text into different sentiment classes such as positive, negative, or neutral based on the underlying sentiment expressed in the text.

Overview
The project generates synthetic data with three sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral) to simulate customer feedback or reviews. It then utilizes the scikit-learn library to preprocess the text data, train a logistic regression model, evaluate its performance, and print the classification report.

Key Features
Synthetic Data Generation: The project generates synthetic data to simulate customer feedback or reviews. This data includes text messages along with their corresponding sentiment labels.

Text Preprocessing: Before training the model, the text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization and vectorization using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.

Logistic Regression Model: The sentiment analysis task is performed using a logistic regression classifier, a simple yet effective machine learning algorithm for binary and multi-class classification tasks.

Model Evaluation: After training the model, its performance is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The classification report provides insights into the model's performance for each sentiment class.
